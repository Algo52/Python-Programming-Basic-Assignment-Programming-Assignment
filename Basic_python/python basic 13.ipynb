      "['Don’t be afraid or ashamed of your fear.']\n",
      "['Our culture glorifies fearlessness. The traditional image of a leader is one who is smart', ' tough', ' and unafraid. But fear', ' like any emotion', ' has an evolutionary purpose and upside. Your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that we’re in a challenging situation. A cautious leader has value. This is especially true in times like these. So don’t get caught up in ruminating: “I shouldn’t be so fearful.”']\n",
      "['Don’t be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and don’t interpret it as evidence that you’re an indecisive leader', ' or not bold', ' not visionary. If you have a natural tendency to be\\xa0prevention-focused', ' channel it to be bold and visionary! (If you struggle to believe this', ' identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters.)']\n",
      "['Use emotional agility skills.']\n",
      "['Fear of mistakes can paralyze people.\\xa0Emotional agility skills\\xa0are an antidote to this paralysis. This process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings', ' such as “I feel anxious I’m not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe.” Stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them. It’s like turning the light on in a dark room. Next comes accepting reality. For example', ' “I understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways.” List off every truth you need to accept. Then comes acting your values. Let’s say one of your highest values is conscientiousness. How might that value apply in this situation? For example', ' it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have. Identify your five most important values related to decision-making in a crisis. Then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face.']\n",
      "['Repeat this process for each of your fears. It will help you tolerate the fact that\\xa0we sometimes need to act when the course of action isn’t clear\\xa0and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to\\xa0reduce uncertainty to zero.']\n",

      "['We can control systems', ' not outcomes. What are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes? Direct your worries into answering questions like these: Is the data you’re relying on reliable? What are the limitations of it? How do your systems help prevent groupthink? What procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots? How do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders? What are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences?']\n",

They drive everywhere', ' even though driving is objectively more dangerous. When you open the aperture', ' it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there. This can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most.']\n",
      "['It might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes. But this strategy can help kick you into problem-solving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you.

Find out what other people’s priorities are.']\n",

      "['As mentioned', ' when people are fearful they can go into always-on monitoring mode. You may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing', ' to always be on social media', ' or check data too frequently. This can result in information overload.
